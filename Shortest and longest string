solution:-
(I added the string also get as output note:- ucan use single loop while check previous is same i didnt try just if u want try )
const str='The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';

let short=Infinity,large=0;
let Lwords=[];
let Swords=[];

let s=str.split(' ');
  console.log(s)


for(let i of s){
  let length = i.length;
  console.log(i);
  if(length>=large){
    large=length
    }
  if(length<=short){
  short=length;
  }
  
}

s.forEach((i)=>{
  if(i.length==large){
    Lwords.push(i)
  }
  
  if(i.length==short){
    Swords.push(i)
  }
});



console.log(`Sums is ${large+short}`)

///if u want remove array remove ouput toSrting method added 
console.log(Lwords.toString());

console.log(Swords.toString())
